# Lead Form Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the fixes implemented to ensure the lead form properly captures and submits the full street address and numeric price values.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Address Issue
- **Problem**: Only the formatted address string was being sent to the API, not parsed address components (streetAddress, city, state, postalCode)
- **Impact**: API couldn't properly store structured address data

### 2. Price Issue  
- **Problem**: The `askingPrice` field was sent as a raw string without parsing
- **Impact**: Price values like "$425,000" or "425K" weren't converted to numeric values

## Solutions Implemented

### Address Parsing Solution

1. **Created address parsing utilities** (`lib/addresses/composeFullAddress.ts`):
   - `parseAddressComponents()` - Parses Google Places components
   - `addressFromPlace()` - Extracts structured address from Places result
   - `validateAddress()` - Validates required address fields

2. **Updated AddressAutocomplete component**:
   - Added `onAddressSelect` callback prop
   - Parses Google Places address components on selection
   - Combines street number + route into full `addressLine1`
   - Extracts city, state, postal code

3. **Updated MultiStepPropertyForm**:
   - Stores parsed address components in form state
   - Passes all address fields to API

### Price Parsing Solution

1. **Created price parsing utilities** (`lib/validation/leadSchema.ts`):
   - `parsePrice()` - Handles multiple formats:
     - Plain numbers: "425000" → 425000
     - Formatted: "$425,000" → 425000  
     - Suffixes: "425K" → 425000, "1.5M" → 1500000
   - Returns `null` for invalid inputs

2. **Added Zod validation schemas**:
   - `completeLeadSchema` - Validates full lead submission
   - `partialLeadSchema` - Validates initial form submission
   - `validateAndTransformLead()` - Validates and transforms data

3. **Updated API routes**:
   - `/api/submit-lead` - Validates data and parses price
   - `/api/submit-partial` - Validates partial submission
   - Both now store structured address components

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Address Parsing**:
- Input: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500"
- Output payload contains:
  - `addressLine1: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW"`
  - `city: "Washington"`
  - `state: "DC"`
  - `postalCode: "20500"`

✅ **Price Parsing**:
- Input: "$425,000" or "425,000" or "425K"
- Output: `price: 425000` (numeric)

✅ **Validation**:
- Zod schemas reject malformed payloads
- Required fields are validated
- Email format is validated
- Property condition and timeline use enums

✅ **Type Safety**:
- End-to-end type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- Shared types between frontend and API

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`__tests__/leadForm.test.ts`)
- Price parsing with various formats
- Phone number formatting
- Address component parsing
- Address validation
- Lead data validation and transformation

### Integration Tests (`__tests__/api/submit-lead.test.ts`)
- Complete form submission with all fields
- Price handling in various formats
- Address component validation
- Error handling for invalid data

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # With coverage report
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `components/MultiStepPropertyForm.tsx` - Added address component fields
- `components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx` - Added address parsing on selection
- `app/api/submit-lead/route.ts` - Added validation and price parsing
- `app/api/submit-partial/route.ts` - Added address component handling

### New Utilities
- `lib/addresses/composeFullAddress.ts` - Address parsing utilities
- `lib/validation/leadSchema.ts` - Validation schemas and price parsing

### Tests
- `__tests__/leadForm.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `__tests__/api/submit-lead.test.ts` - API integration tests
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.js` - Test setup

## Regression Prevention

1. **Validation Layer**: Zod schemas ensure data consistency
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces prevent type mismatches
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for edge cases
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing/invalid data

## Usage Example

When a user submits the form with:
- Address: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500"
- Price: "$425,000"

The API receives:
```json
{
  "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500",
  "addressLine1": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW",
  "city": "Washington",
  "state": "DC",
  "postalCode": "20500",
  "price": 425000,
  "askingPrice": "$425,000",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Monitoring

The implementation includes console logging for debugging:
- Address component parsing details
- Price parsing results  
- Validation errors
- API payload structure

These can be monitored in production logs to ensure proper operation.
